### Repository archival

The petition traffic has slowed to a crawl, it has been responded to, and debated by Parliament.  I'm disabling the update cronjob and archiving this repository.  Jonty is doing [a far better job](https://github.com/Jonty/uk_petitions_data) than I am in archiving this and other petitions' metadata.

We should have left the EU by now, but instead Parliament passed legislation in record time to prevent the cliff-edge No Deal scenario, and the EU has agreed to extend the Article 50 deadline to the 31st of October (with an "is the UK behaving responsibly" checkpoint on the 30th of June).  The UK has now been forced to participate in the [EU Parliament elections](https://www.yourvotematters.co.uk/how-am-i-represented/european-parliment) on the 22nd of May, and this critical vote will help shape these next few months.

**Make sure you are [registered to vote](https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote) by midnight, Tuesday 7th of May to be able to participate in the conversation.**

This petition, while in no way binding, and in some respects not wholly representative of national sentiment, nevertheless formed an important part of the movement to prevent Brexit causing total disaster in the United Kingdom, and the numbers are an important part of that.

### Government response 2019-03-26

> This Government will not revoke Article 50. We will honour the result of the 2016 referendum and work with Parliament to deliver a deal that ensures we leave the European Union.
> 
> It remains the Government’s firm policy not to revoke Article 50. We will honour the outcome of the 2016 referendum and work to deliver an exit which benefits everyone, whether they voted to Leave or to Remain.
> 
> Revoking Article 50, and thereby remaining in the European Union, would undermine both our democracy and the trust that millions of voters have placed in Government.
> 
> The Government acknowledges the considerable number of people who have signed this petition. However, close to three quarters of the electorate took part in the 2016 referendum, trusting that the result would be respected. This Government wrote to every household prior to the referendum, promising that the outcome of the referendum would be implemented. 17.4 million people then voted to leave the European Union, providing the biggest democratic mandate for any course of action ever directed at UK Government.
> 
> British people cast their votes once again in the 2017 General Election where over 80% of those who voted, voted for parties, including the Opposition, who committed in their manifestos to upholding the result of the referendum.
> 
> This Government stands by this commitment.
> 
> Revoking Article 50 would break the promises made by Government to the British people, disrespect the clear instruction from a democratic vote, and in turn, reduce confidence in our democracy. As the Prime Minister has said, failing to deliver Brexit would cause “potentially irreparable damage to public trust”, and it is imperative that people can trust their Government to respect their votes and deliver the best outcome for them.
